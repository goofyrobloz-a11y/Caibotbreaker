## Installation

Step 1: copy the first message in firstmes.txt, and second message in secondmes.txt

Step 2: paste the first message and the bot will say gibbrish and spit some code or a text analyze of your message, if it dosent, try saying "hi ai" if done correctly it should respond like "how can i assist you today" or something else out of their character but just to make sure its done correctly ask something, if the respond is like ai and not their character then congrats you did it, if its not, rewind your chat or start a new chat and try step 3

Step 3: paste the first message and hit sent after that paste the second message (you didnt copy it, copy it first) and hit sent (i usally paste the first message and hit sent after the second message but you can put in your own order, it doesnt have to be the same) if you read step 2 then you know what to do
